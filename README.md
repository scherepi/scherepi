Hi, I'm Joaquin! I'm a young cybersecurity student and developer currently active in [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com). I'm interested in a lot of different technologies and techniques, from Linux (Kali, Arch, and Raspbian) to Java (ITS certified btw) to hardware hacking. I'm currently studying for my **CompTIA Security+** certification, and you can find my personal website at [jschere.com](https://jschere.com). Right now, I'm working on some projects for Hack Club's [Shipwrecked](https://shipwrecked.hackclub.com) event. Hope to see you in Boston!

Here are some projects I'm extra proud of:
- [Conduit](https://github.com/scherepi/conduit), an awesome local tunnel system built in Bun and TypeScript that makes sharing your projects a breeze. Built for Shipwrecked with my friends [Gus](https://github.com/gusruben) and [Sebastian](https://github.com/XDagging).
- [Playgrate](https://github.com/scherepi/playgrate) is a webapp that lets you migrate playlists from Apple Music to Spotify. More music services are yet to come! (If you want to contribute a scraping module, that'd be awesome!)
- [Now Playing LCD](https://github.com/scherepi/nowplayingLCD), a really fun little program that displays what I'm currently listening to on a cute LCD display on my desk, using a Flask webserver to authenticate to Spotify through OAuth.
- [You Throw Me](https://github.com/gusruben/you-throw-me), a game I made with Gus and Sebastian about throwing your phone. We won **3rd place** at Hack Club's [Scrapyard](https://scrapyard.hackclub.com) hackathon, and got featured by the laptop brand [Framework](https://frame.work/hacktheworld)!
- [jschere.com](https://jschere.com), my website!

Hi, I'm Joaquin! I'm a young cybersecurity student and developer currently active in [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com). I'm interested in a lot of different technologies and techniques, from Linux (Kali, Arch, and Raspbian) to Java (ITS certified btw) to hardware hacking. I'm currently studying for my **CompTIA Security+** certification, and you can find my personal website at [jschere.com](https://jschere.com). I had an absolute blast at Hack Club's [Shipwrecked](https://shipwrecked.hackclub.com) event in August, and I'll never forget it. At the minute, I'm taking a gap year to work on various pursuits and projects.

Here are some projects I'm extra proud of:
- [Conduit](https://github.com/scherepi/conduit), an awesome local tunnel system built in Bun and TypeScript that makes sharing your projects a breeze. Built for Shipwrecked with my friends [Gus](https://github.com/gusruben) and [Sebastian](https://github.com/XDagging). <i>NOW FEATURING ENCRYPTION!</i>
- [Playgrate](https://playgrate.live) is a webapp that lets you migrate playlists from Apple Music to Spotify. More music services are yet to come! (If you want to contribute a scraping module, that'd be awesome!)
- [Troubadour](https://troubadour-blue.vercel.app), a personal lyrical analysis database built because I hate Genius. Now, you can keep all your wonderful and insightful annotations for California Gurls in one organized place.
- [You Throw Me](https://github.com/gusruben/you-throw-me), a game I made with Gus and Sebastian about throwing your phone. We won **3rd place** at Hack Club's [Scrapyard](https://scrapyard.hackclub.com) hackathon, and got featured by the laptop brand [Framework](https://frame.work/hacktheworld)!
- [cursedOS](https://github.com/scherepi/cursedOS), an x86 operating system built from scratch in Rust with my close friend [Lou](https://github.com/v1peridae) while she stayed with me. Still a work in progress, but a fun exercise in unconventional low-level design.
- [PopSyn](pop-syn.vercel.app) is a neat little web app I built at Shipwrecked with Lou and Sebastian that derives a color from the lyrical contents of a song, and lets you vote on what your idea of its color is.
- [jschere.com](https://jschere.com), my website!

Hi, I'm Joaquin! I'm a young cybersecurity student and developer currently active in [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com). I'm interested in a lot of different technologies and techniques, from Linux (gotta love Kali and Arch) to Java (ITS certified btw) to hardware hacking. I'm currently studying for my **CompTIA Security+** certification, and you can find my personal website at [jschere.com](https://jschere.com). Right now, I'm working on some projects for Hack Club's [Shipwrecked](https://shipwrecked.hackclub.com) event. Hope to see you in Boston!

Here are some projects I'm extra proud of:
- [Playgrate](https://github.com/scherepi/playgrate), my current Shipwrecked project, is a webapp that lets you migrate playlists from Apple Music to Spotify. More music services are yet to come! (If you want to contribute a scraping module, that'd be awesome!)
- [Now Playing LCD](https://github.com/scherepi/nowplayingLCD), a really fun little program that displays what I'm currently listening to on a cute LCD display on my desk, using a Flask webserver to authenticate to Spotify through OAuth.
- [jschere.com](https://jschere.com), my website!
